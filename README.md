# Borealis template by Fatjon Freskina :snowflake:

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/07b0b949-a350-43bc-b296-a051da2ea2b9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/borealis-template/deploys)

The idea is to create a simple, responsive and easy to customize template for small businesses, startups or personal projects. The template is built with Vue3 using the options API and Bootstrap5. The goal is to keep it simple and easy to customize, so you can focus on the content and not on the code.

Demo can be found [here](https://borealis-template.netlify.app/) :link:
